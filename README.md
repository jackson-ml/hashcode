# Hashcode 2020

#### Collaborated with Kaito Nakatani, Jason Ngo, and Jiajie Ma at Haverford College.

This repo contains our solution to Google's 2020 Hashcode programming competition, where we work together as a team of four to solve an optimization problem in 4 hours. I organized a team with a few other math/cs dual majors that I had classes with to take on the challenge.


### The Problem

The Hashcode 2020 problem was centered around Google Books. Google Books is a vast digital archive of information, but the logistical problem of how to actually enter books into that archive raises interesting questions. Should short books be prioritized? Or ones in high demand? To solve the Hashcode 2020 problem, we had to optimize the total "book score" that our algorithm scanned, given constraints about the rate that libraries can scan books, the time it takes to enroll a library in the program, the time that our algorithm runs, and individual book values.
